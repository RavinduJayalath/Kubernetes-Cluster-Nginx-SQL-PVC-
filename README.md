This project involves setting up a two-node Kubernetes cluster on a Linux virtual machine to deploy a PHP CRUD application with a MySQL database. The application, which is currently non-containerized, will be managed using Kubernetes resources such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and PersistentVolumes to ensure proper configuration, secure handling of credentials, and persistent data storage. Docker is used as the container runtime on both the Linux VM and the host Windows machine, while kubectl manages the cluster operations. The project demonstrates a complete Kubernetes workflow, including application deployment, database integration, configuration management, and storage orchestration, providing a scalable and maintainable infrastructure for modern applications.
